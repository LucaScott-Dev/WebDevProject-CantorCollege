            <h1>Rules Governing the Use of the Library and Resource Centre</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members of the Library and 
                Resource Centre and to use the facilities for the purpose of their course of study or College 
                employment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Membership may also be extended to other individuals or to persons nominated from outside 
                organisations; a fee is normally charged. Access for study purposes may also be granted to 
                non-members by arrangement. Details are available in the External Services leaflet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of the facilities implies acceptance of the Library and Resource Centre rules. These rules 
                protect the interests of all users and ensure that the College can operate within the law and 
                function effectively. They apply at all sites, including workstation rooms and site libraries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Admission to the Library and Resource Centre is conditional upon observing these rules, which staff 
                are empowered to enforce. Breaches may be dealt with through Library disciplinary action or, if 
                appropriate, through the College’s student or staff procedures.
            </p>
